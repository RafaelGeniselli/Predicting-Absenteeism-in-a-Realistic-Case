# Predicting-Absenteeism-in-a-Realistic-Case

#This Business Case creates a Machine Learning algorythm that can predict the Excessive Absenteeism probability of each worker based in a series of variables and a previos collected dataset information. This is a study case of my degree in the Complete Data Science Bootcamp 2023 (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp/).
## *Introduction*
The goal of this project is to apply the data science and statistical skills learned in the course to predict the absenteeism probability of workers to have excessive absence hours(more than 3) taking in consideration a serios of features (Various diseases, Poisoning, Pregnancy, Distance From Work, Pets, Children). in a real business case 

The aim of the project was divided into 4 sections:

* *Looking into the Dataset*: identifying possible difficulties during the analysis process.
* *Pre-processing the Dataset and applying logistic regression*: try to identify the features correlations to explain the target's value (Excessive Absenteeism).
* *Building a Model* Training a model that takes in consideration the features and find the best model to improve the prediction.
* *Plot the information*  in TableuPublic (https:/www.tableau.com/) and analyze the generated graphics.

##  *File Description*
* Notebook: 
    Jupyter notebook with all data analyses, preparations and modeling tests.
    TabluePublic graphics with the analysis with most important features observed in our case (Age vs Probability / Reasons vs Probability / Transportation Expenses + Children vs Probability)
* Data:
    - Absenteeism_module - Contains all the coding used in this process.
 
##  *Software and Libraries*
* This project uses Python 3.7.2 and the following libraries:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Pickle](https://pickle.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
